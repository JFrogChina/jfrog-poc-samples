# üöÄ Using JFrog SaaS with Amazon EKS: Do You Still Need ECR?

Yes ‚Äî even when you use **JFrog SaaS** to pull your application container images in EKS, **Amazon EKS still needs ECR (Public)** for Kubernetes system images.

## üß© Image Type Breakdown

| Image Type                 | Default Source         | Can JFrog Replace It?     |
|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Kubernetes system images  | **ECR Public**         | ‚ùå Not recommended         |
| Application workloads     | **JFrog SaaS**         | ‚úÖ Yes, for security scanning and compliance              |

## üîπ Kubernetes System Images

EKS relies on Amazon-hosted images for system components:

```
public.ecr.aws/eks/*
```

Examples:
- CoreDNS
- kube-proxy
- pause
- aws-node (CNI)

These are:
- Automatically pulled during node provisioning
- Publicly accessible (no secrets required)
- Maintained and updated by AWS

‚úÖ You don‚Äôt need to configure anything for them.

## üîπ Application/Business Images (JFrog SaaS)

Use JFrog SaaS to host:
- Microservice images
- Build outputs from CI/CD

Recommended to use:
- **IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)**
- **JFrog Registry Operator** (SecretRotator)

This setup:
- Avoids storing passwords or static credentials
- Automatically generates and rotates imagePullSecrets

---

## üîê Why You Still Need ECR

- EKS system components (e.g., CoreDNS) are not hosted by JFrog
- Keeping them in ECR ensures compatibility, updates, and cluster health
- While technically possible to re-host them in JFrog, it adds complexity

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. Let **EKS use ECR** (default) for Kubernetes system images
2. Use **JFrog SaaS** for your private application containers
3. Set up **IRSA + JFrog Operator** for secure access
4. Only attach `imagePullSecrets` where required (Jfrog registry)
